- 👋 Hi, I’m @TigerJon4
- 👀 I’m interested in Python on the Raspberry Pi, and the Mac
- And controlling voltmeters, power supplies etc
- 🌱 I’m am an old school programmer.  I know Assembly language and Basic in many forms including excel VBA which I love.
-  The librarys and other attributes of Python make it super atractive, and I am on the learning curve.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything with an Analog/Digital interface (Sensors) and instrumentation.
- 📫 How to reach me ... jad69@yahoo.com is my junk email, but if you put PYTHON in the subject I can search fo and get it!
- I live in Silicon Valleyt Calif and I am down to meet interesting people and BUILD.
